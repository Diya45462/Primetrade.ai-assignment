Assignment for data science intern role at Primetrade.ai 

Based on the content of your uploaded Jupyter Notebook, here is README material you can use for your project.

Financial Sentiment Analysis: Fear & Greed Index
Project Overview
This project performs data analysis on financial market indicators, specifically focusing on the Fear & Greed Index. The objective is to analyze historical data from an Excel dataset (fear_greed_index.xlsx) to understand market sentiment trends.

Features
Data Import: Automated loading of Excel data files within a Google Colab environment.

Data Analysis: Utilizing pandas and numpy for efficient data manipulation and numerical analysis.

Visualization: Generating insightful plots using matplotlib and seaborn to visualize sentiment fluctuations over time.

Prerequisites
To run this notebook, you will need the following Python libraries installed:

pandas

numpy

matplotlib

seaborn

openpyxl (for Excel file support)

Setup and Usage
Open in Colab: Upload the ASSIGNMENT.ipynb file to your Google Colab account.

Upload Data: When prompted by the notebook's execution cells, upload the fear_greed_index.xlsx file.

To run the code provided in the ASSIGNMENT.ipynb notebook, follow these steps designed for a Google Colab environment:

1. Environment Setup
Open Google Colab: Go to colab.research.google.com and upload the ASSIGNMENT.ipynb file.

Library Requirements: The notebook requires several standard Python libraries for data analysis and visualization:

pandas

numpy

matplotlib

seaborn

2. Execution Steps
Import Libraries: Run the first cell to import the necessary data processing and plotting packages.

Upload Data Files:

The notebook contains specific cells that use from google.colab import files to prompt for a file upload.

When you run these cells, a "Choose Files" button will appear. You must select and upload the corresponding Excel file, such as fear_greed_index.xlsx.

Run Sequential Cells: After the data is successfully uploaded (you will see a message like "Saving fear_greed_index.xlsx to fear_greed_index.xlsx"), continue running the remaining cells in order to process the data and generate visualizations.
